This is my personal project, which is called as RiP.
• Users sign up into the application by providing their email, username and password which undergo encryption and stored in an XAMPP SQL database.
Authentication guarantees access to personalized financial data for each user.
• The application enables users to track their income, expenses and savings by allowing them to input transaction entry, including transaction type (income or
expense), category, date, and amount.
• In my application, this feature operates as the "Summary," employed Chart.js to craft visually captivating representations of financial data, including visualizations
such as net worth over time, monthly expenses, and breakdowns of expenses by category.
